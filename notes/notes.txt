"Pure functions are restricted in that they cannot have side effects or change behavior over time. "

HOF definition:
    A function that manipulates other functions as data is called a higher order function (HOF).
    For instance, a HOF can be a function that takes functions as arguments, returns a function
    as its value, or both.

pattern for designing recursive functions:
 - start with a base case, conditional statement for function inputs that are >>>simplest<<< 
   to process
 - base case is followed by one or more recursive calls. recursive calls have one goal:
   >>>simplifying the original problem<<<.
   recursive functions express computation by simplifying problems incremendially
     
leap of faith:
 - treating a recursive call as a function abstraction
 
mutual recursion:
 - a recursive procedure is divided by two functions calling each other  

- clearify "proof by induction"

running doc tests:
python3 -m doctest -v hog.py


noetherian induction:
a relation on values is well founded if there are no infinite decending chaines.

"If you start at some value and keep stepping to smaller values (according to the relation)
then you must always get to a minimal value after finite steps."

swap:

score + margin = opponent score : return 0

harmful

opponent score + margin = score: return num_rolls
